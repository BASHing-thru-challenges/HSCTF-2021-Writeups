hmm, fibonacci is fun, right?

## Solution
Despite few solves, I had an easier time with this than [not-really-math](https://github.com/BASHing-thru-challenges/HSCTF-2021-Writeups/tree/main/algo/not-really-math).
I wrote a basic python function ``fib(n)`` that gives me the Fibonacci number in the sequence F<sub>n</sub> using recursion:
```python3

def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

```
I did the same thing for the Extended Fibonacci sequence S<sub>n</sub> again with recursion:
```python3

def exFib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "0" + str(fib(n))
    return exFib(n - 1) + str(fib(n))

```
At this point I could find the summation of the series using a for loop and a list. I used a string slice to grab the last 11 digits of the number and sent it to the nc server
with pwntools.

After attempting I realised my fib calculations were way to slow. I used a library called functools to easily cache previously calculated fibs to speed up the program and it
did the trick.

Final script:
```python3

from pwn import *
import functools
import re

@functools.lru_cache(None)
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

@functools.lru_cache(None)
def exFib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "0" + str(fib(n))
    return exFib(n - 1) + str(fib(n))

def addList(list):
    total = 0
    for num in list:
        total += num
    return total

io = process(['nc', 'extended-fibonacci-sequence.hsc.tf', '1337'])
io.recvline()
while True:
    try:
        data = io.recvuntil(":").decode()
    except EOFError:
        print(io.recvline().decode())
        quit()
    n = int(re.search("(\d{1,})\n", data).group(0))
    print("[RECIEVE]: " + str(n))
    summ = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        summ.append(int(exFib(i).lstrip('0')))
    final = str(addList(summ))
    final = final[len(final) - 11:]
    io.sendline(final)
    print("[SEND]: " + final)

```
Run the script and out pops the flag!
