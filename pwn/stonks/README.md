## Description

`nc stonks.hsc.tf 1337`

## Solution
Disclosure: There is no technical "pwning" done in this solution since we're bad at pwn

Once we connect, we can do some initial fuzzing with different characters and lengths, and we find that we can crash it with a simple buffer overflow (which explains the large # of solves as well). Now, we could go into gdb and write an exploit manually, but since I'm a script kiddie I decided to use [autorop](https://github.com/mariuszskon/autorop) which is a great tool for simple pwns like this. Following the syntax, we are brought to an interactive shell as shown below.

As shown above, once we get to the interactive shell, all we have to do is `ls` and  `cat flag`, allowing us to solve this challenge in under a minute. Clearly, sometimes being a script kiddie does pay off.

## Flag
`flag{to_the_moon}`
